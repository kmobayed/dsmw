ChangeLog for TDB
=================

==== 0.8.4

+ Experimental: filtering of quads (to support dynamic datasets and graph masking at some time).
+ Include src-examples in sources shipped.
+ Bug fix: Turtle and N-triples reader could use the blank nod elbal as given, 
  not treat as a per run scoped label.    

==== 0.8.3

+ Concurrency fixes
+ Speed up reforming nodes from the on-disk representation.
+ (From ARQ) Speed up complex nested optionals.  BSBM now works on all thier dataset sizes.
+ Speed up basic processing of DateTime nodes (avoid using String.format to remake lexcial forms!) 

+ Bug fix: If the query has a dataset description, this was ignored.  
  Now if the query has a dataset description (FROM, FROM NAMED) then
  an in-memory query execution is done on the loaded files and the TDB
  dataset is ignored.

==== 0.8.2

+ TDB-backed graphs at the same location now use the shared dataset.
  This means all created modesl in a JVM shared TDB caches.
  
+ All tables now created even for just a graph or model
  (including the named graph quad tables).

+ Bug fix: asking the size of a empty graph before any other operation would make the size zero 
  for the rest of the lifetime of the in-memory graph.  No data corruption on disk.

+ Bug fix: language tags on """-strings were causing a parse error. 
      
==== 0.8.1

+ Fix bug when assembling one unnamed graph. 

==== 0.8.0

** The on-disk file format has changed : datasets must be reloaded **

+ TDBFactory now caches datatsets as they are created.  
  Opening a dataset anywhere in the same JVM will return the same dataset.
  Closing this dataset immediately releases resources and closes the dataset
  everywhere in the JVM.   
  
+ A named graph of <urn:x-arq:UnionGraph>  is the RDF merge of all named graphs in a dataset.
  This is now supported as a graph name when accessing one graph in a dataset via the
  programmtic API calls.  Update directly to the  union graph is not allowed; update of
  any named graph wil be immediately visible in the union graph.
  
+ A named graph of <urn:x-arq:DefaultGraph> is the same as the unnamed graph in a dataset. 

+ Upgrade to Java5 version of ARQ and Jena

+ Copes with spaces in URIs (strongly not recommended)

+ Internal general purpose (non-RDF) library code all moved under package "atlas"

+ Faster Turtle reader (combined underpinning with N-Triples bulkreader).  

==== 0.7.3

+ Execution logging now catches all execution paths

+ Metadata files attached to database files.  
  New files will appear in the database directory.

+ "tdbtest" renamed "tdbverify".  New "tdbtest" runs an individual test 
   manifest (similar to ARQ and SDB). 

Bug fixes:

- Query over the union of named graphs only works in simple cases.  
  Now works for any pattern. 

- Stats optimizer: failed to gracefully handle abbreviated patterns with TERM

==== 0.7.2

Bug fixes:

- The comand line tools did not work with a location and a named graph.

- removeAll(s,p,o) added.  Improve Model.removeAll()

- Bug fixes to B+tree indexing on deletion. 

==== 0.7.1

Bug fixes:

- Dataset.containsNamedModel on a TDB-backed data store always returns false.
  Now returns true if there are any triples in that graph.
  
- removeAll could cause an exception.
  Known issue but could manifest itself in strange ways
  Temporary fix applied - functionally correct but may use significant amounts of memory.
  
- Persistent prefixes might not work with RDF/XML even if they did for other formats.
  Fixed. 
   
==== 0.7.0

+ Named graph support
  Native TDB support for RDF datasets, including a quads table.
  Preliminary.

+ Reification: Support for Reification style "standard" 

+ Upgrade to slf4j 1.5.6 (2 jar names change)

==== 0.6.0

+ Added optimizer (statistics based) 
+ (32 bit OS) Added a transaction handler that will cause cached changes
  to be flushed to disk.  This is not ACID semantics and no abort is possible.   

==== 0.5.3

+ Bug fixes: concurrency control for on-disk files
